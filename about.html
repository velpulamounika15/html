          Nicholas James Vujicic was born on 4th December 1982 with Tetra-amelia syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by the absence of 
          all four limbs. 
          As a child, he struggled mentally and emotionally, as well as physically, 
        but eventually came to terms with his disability and, at the age of seventeen, started his own non-profit organization,
         Life Without Limbs. Because Vujicic does not let his disability overtake his life, he has learned how drive, 
         beat a drum, write, pen an autobiography, use the computer, play tennis, and even surf. Vujicic presents motivational speeches worldwide,
          on life with a disability, hope, and finding meaning in life (Wikipedia). Nick Vujicic has touched me and so I want to share with you.
